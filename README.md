# OpenCVInsti
example code used to recognize the insti test

to use:
download the opencv 3.4.3 android sdk from sourceforge
remove /app/src/main/jniLibs
on mac/linux create a symbolic link named /app/src/main/jniLibs to [your openCV source directory]/sdk/native/libs

on windows copy [your opencv source director]/sdk/native/libs to /app/src/main/jniLibs

if this doesn't immediately run contact me lol
